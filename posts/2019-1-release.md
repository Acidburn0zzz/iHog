It's time to release another app! It's called iHog4 OSC Remote. It's an app that sends [Open Sound Control](http://opensoundcontrol.org/introduction-osc) (OSC) commands to [Hog 4 lighting consoles](https://www.highend.com/products/consoles). This app is only available on iPadOS 13 and above.

# But why? Don't other apps exist for this?

There are already some options out there for this like TouchOSC and Hog4Remote, and those are great options, but there is one feature that they are both lacking. That feature is being able to select fixtures from a group and put them in a palette. This was the whole point of making the app because it is something that I felt would be really useful.

# Features of the app

# How much does it cost?

It's a one time purchase of $1.99. There are in-app purchases to help future development. There is no pressure to do this, it is 100% optional and does not impact the apps features.
